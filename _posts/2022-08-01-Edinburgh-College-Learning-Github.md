# Starting to Learn Comp Sci!
Signed up to an online self guided course at Edinburgh College, and it starts today, so here I am half watching 8 out of 10 cats does coutndown, and starting to learns the ins and out of GitHub.
It's a terrible way to start, but I need to get out of my current job eventually and maybe make some more cash $$$
